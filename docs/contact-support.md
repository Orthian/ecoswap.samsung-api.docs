## Best Practices for Support Requests

- **Be Specific:** Clearly state which endpoint, event, or error code is causing trouble.
- **Include Examples:** If possible, provide a sample request/response (with sensitive info redacted) that demonstrates the issue.
- **Log Details:** Share request IDs, timestamps (in UTC), and any correlation IDs included in responses. This speeds up the investigation process.

**Remember:** The more detailed and organized your initial request, the faster we can assist.
