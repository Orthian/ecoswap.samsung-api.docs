# Testing & Validation

A thorough testing and validation strategy helps ensure a smooth integration before moving to production.

## Recommended Approach

1. **Development Environment:**  
   - Validate token generation and refreshing.
   - Confirm that RSA/AES decryption works correctly.
   - Test handling of each event (`SO_CREATE`, submitting price/grade to Samsung, and `SO_RESULT`).
   - Simulate various error conditions (e.g., invalid tokens, malformed requests).

2. **Staging Environment (UAT):**  
   - Use realistic test data and scenarios to mimic production conditions.
   - Coordinate with Samsung’s team to verify that events are triggered correctly and that responses match expectations.
   - Validate that EcoSwap’s system updates and reflects the correct device grades, pricing, and final order statuses in a stable, reproducible environment.
   - Confirm that performance and response times meet required SLAs.

3. **Production Environment:**  
   - Move to production after passing all tests and UAT.
   - Monitor logs and metrics closely during initial rollout.
   - Have a rollback or incident response plan ready if unexpected issues occur.

## Key Validation Steps

- **Token Management:**  
  Ensure that tokens are requested and refreshed correctly. Test both successful and failure scenarios.
  
  <details>
  <summary>Example: Test Token Expiration & Refresh</summary>
  
  **Scenario:**  
  1. Obtain an access token and store it.  
  2. Wait until the token is near expiry or manually invalidate it.  
  3. Attempt to use the expired token on a secure endpoint.  
     - Expected: Receive a `00401 Unauthorized` error.  
  4. Use the `refreshToken` to obtain a new token pair.  
     - Expected: Receive a `200` response with a new `token` and `refreshToken`.
  5. Retest the endpoint with the new token.  
     - Expected: Successful response (e.g., `200`, `status.code: "00000"`).
  </details>

- **Decryption Validation (RSA & AES):**  
  Confirm that `encryptedKey` and `payload` are correctly decrypted.
  
  <details>
  <summary>Example: Test Decryption Process</summary>
  
  **Scenario:**  
  1. Simulate a `SO_CREATE` request with a known AES key and payload.  
  2. Use `private.pem` to RSA-decrypt the `encryptedKey`.  
  3. AES-decrypt the `payload` using the recovered key.  
     - Expected: The decrypted JSON payload matches the known input JSON used before encryption.
  4. Compare device details, images, and statuses with expected values.
  </details>

- **Event Handling:**  
  Test all event types to ensure correct processing and data flow:
  
  <details>
  <summary>Example: SO_CREATE Event Handling</summary>
  
  **Scenario:**  
  1. Send a `SO_CREATE` event with a valid `soId` and device details.  
  2. Confirm EcoSwap responds with `200` and `"status": "received"`.  
  3. Check EcoSwap’s database or logs to ensure the order is recorded with correct details.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Example: Submit Price & Grade to Samsung</summary>
  
  **Scenario:**  
  1. After receiving `SO_CREATE`, decide a price and grade (`evaluateGrade="A"`, `evaluatePrice="8000"`).
  2. Call Samsung’s `submitprice` endpoint with the evaluated data.  
     - Expected: `200` response and `code: "00000"`, ensuring submission is successful.
  3. Repeat with invalid prices or states to trigger error responses (e.g., `09400` Already bid).
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Example: SO_RESULT Event Handling</summary>
  
  **Scenario:**  
  1. Samsung sends `SO_RESULT` with `biddingResult="WIN"` and `soStatus="ACCEPTED"`.  
  2. EcoSwap should respond with `200` and `"status": "success"`.  
  3. Verify that the final order state in EcoSwap’s system matches the provided result and that any customer data is stored or handled as expected.
  </details>

- **Error Scenarios & Edge Cases:**  
  Ensure the integration handles incorrect or unexpected inputs gracefully.
  
  <details>
  <summary>Example: Invalid SO ID</summary>
  
  **Scenario:**  
  1. Send a `SO_CREATE` or `SO_RESULT` event with a non-existent or malformed `soId`.
  2. Expected: `00404 Data not found` or appropriate error code.
  3. Confirm that error handling logs are generated and no partial data is stored.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Example: Unauthorized Requests</summary>
  
  **Scenario:**  
  1. Attempt to call EcoSwap endpoints without a valid token (or with a tampered token).  
  2. Expected: `00401 Unauthorized` response.  
  3. Check that no sensitive data is exposed and no unintended data changes occur.
  </details>

## Performance & Load Testing

- **Response Time Checks:**  
  Validate that average and peak response times meet the agreed-upon SLA (e.g., ≤ 300 ms for `SO_CREATE`).

- **Load Testing (Optional):**  
  Test with multiple concurrent requests to ensure that EcoSwap’s system scales and maintains performance under expected workloads.

<details>
<summary>Example: Load Testing</summary>

**Scenario:**  
1. Send 100 `SO_CREATE` events concurrently.  
2. Monitor response times and error rates.  
   - Expected: No significant increase in errors; response times remain acceptable.
</details>

## Tracking & Reporting

- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  Use logs, metrics, and dashboards to track the integration’s health during testing.
  
- **Issue Tracking:**  
  Record any discovered defects in a ticketing system (e.g., JIRA) and retest once they’re resolved.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Functional:**  
  All required events (SO_CREATE, submit price/grade, SO_RESULT) process successfully under normal conditions.
  
- **Security & Privacy:**  
  All data is decrypted correctly, no unauthorized access is possible, and no sensitive data leaks.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  System returns appropriate error responses and never fails silently.
  
- **Stability:**  
  Sustained normal operations under realistic load conditions.

Once all tests pass in the Development and Staging environments, the solution is deemed ready for Production deployment.
