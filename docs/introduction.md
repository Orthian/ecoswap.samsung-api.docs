# Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive roadmap for integrating Samsung’s trade-in service with EcoSwap’s platform. By following the guidelines herein, you can ensure a secure, scalable, and streamlined trade-in experience—from the moment a sales order is created, through device evaluation, to the final confirmation.

## Key Integration Steps

1. **SO_CREATE:**  
   When a customer initiates a trade-in at a Samsung store or online platform, Samsung’s system sends an event to EcoSwap, introducing a new Sales Order (SO). This SO creation event includes essential details such as:
   - Device specifications (brand, model, IMEI)
   - Staff and shop information
   - Initial offer status (e.g., OFFER, ACCEPTED, CANCEL)

2. **Submit Price & Grade:**  
   After receiving the SO_CREATE event, EcoSwap evaluates the device’s condition. Factors like body integrity, screen condition, and operator lock status contribute to determining a fair, market-aligned price. EcoSwap then pushes this evaluated price and device grade back to Samsung:
   - Ensuring transparency and consistency in valuation.
   - Allowing Samsung to present the final price to the customer confidently.

3. **SO_RESULT:**  
   Once the customer makes a final decision—accepting the quoted price or canceling the trade-in—Samsung sends the SO_RESULT event back to EcoSwap. This final status update allows EcoSwap to:
   - Complete internal order processing.
   - Update inventory records.
   - Provide accurate reporting for financial and operational insights.

## Data Security & Integrity

To protect sensitive information and maintain trust, all data exchanges are encrypted using a robust RSA-AES combination. JWT-based authentication further ensures only authorized requests access EcoSwap’s endpoints. This dual-layered security design:
- Safeguards customer and transactional data against unauthorized access.
- Maintains data integrity throughout the entire trade-in lifecycle.

## Scalable & Efficient Workflow

The integration is built with performance and scalability in mind:
- **Load handling:** The architecture supports handling high volumes of concurrent orders without degrading response times.
- **Token-based authentication:** Easily scales as the number of transactions and services grow.
- **Environment-tiered approach:** Dedicated development, staging, and production environments enable careful testing and validation before live deployment.

## Audience & Use Cases

This guide is tailored for:
- **Technical Integration Teams**
- **Solution Architects**
- **Backend Developers**

Whether you are drafting initial integration blueprints, troubleshooting mid-development issues, or reviewing production performance, this documentation provides the granular detail and structured guidance you need to implement, maintain, and optimize the Samsung-EcoSwap trade-in integration.

In short, by adhering to the best practices and specifications outlined in this document, both Samsung and EcoSwap teams can deliver a seamless, secure, and efficient trade-in journey that enhances customer satisfaction and operational clarity.
